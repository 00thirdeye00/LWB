How to integrate this source code into Code Composer Studio:

1. Create a new project: File > New > Project... > C/C++ Makefile Project
   Click 'next' and enter the project name as well as the path to the source folder.
   
2. Modify the project settings: Project > Properties
   Go to "C/C++ General > Paths and Symbols > Include > GNU C" and add the path to the msp430 include files (typically /usr/msp430/include).
   Go to "C/C++ Build > Behaviour" and clear the content of the textbox next to 'incremental build'.
  
3. Remove unused folders: The syntax checker gets confused when there are several folder in the subfolder 'mcu' or 'platform'. Therefore, delete all
   unused folders. If you e.g. want to compile the code for the Olimex MSP430-CCRF, then only keep 'mcu/cc430' and 'platform/olimex-ccrf'.
   
4. If necessary, modify the 'Makefile' in the Contiki root folder.
   Adjust APPDIR (the directory of the application to compile) and TARGET (the target platform).

5. In order to flash/debug the program onto the target device, you need to create a new debug configuration: "File > New > Target Configuration File > Finish"
   The file will open and allow you to set the 'Connection' and 'Board or Device' types. Save the file and then go to "Run > Debug Configurations", select 
   the new configuration on the left and then set the program binary (.exe) in the tab 'Program'.
   In the tab 'Target', make sure "Connect to the target on debugger startup" is enabled in the 'launch options'.
   Click 'Apply' and then 'Debug'.
