/**
 * @brief Low-Power Wireless Bus Test Application
 * 
 * @note
 * Notes on Processes in Contiki: 
 * 
 * The only process control function that can be called from preemptive
 * mode (ISR) is process_poll().
 * A process can send a PROCESS_EVENT_MSG event asynchronously to some other
 * process, with a pointer to the message:
 *   process_post(&example_process, PROCESS_EVENT_CONTINUE, msg);
 * A msg can also be passed 
 * synchronously with:
 *   process_post_synch(&example_process, PROCESS_EVENT_MSG, msg);
 * 
 * A process can yield to other processes by calling PROCESS_YIELD(), in which
 * case it will wait for any event (equivalent to PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT()).
 * Alternatively, use PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT(), PROCESS_WAIT_EVENT_UNTIL() or 
 * PROCESS_WAIT_UNTIL() or PROCESS_PAUSE().
 * 
 * Remark: Protothreads are stackless threads optimized for event-driven OSs.
 * They are basically a function.
 * A process can react to events. 
 * 
 * @remarks 
 * - use "msp430-objdump -h <filename>" to print out all linker sections, their location and size; besides, gcc outputs the size of the RO (.text) and RAM (.bss + .data) sections
 * - make sure the unused RAM space for the stack is at least 100 B (check .bss section) -> 4 kB - .bss region - heap (should be 0) = max_stack_size
 * - the max. period may be much longer than 30s, test showed that even 30min are feasible (note though that the period is a uint8 variable with the last bit reserved)
 * - sprintf is very inefficient (~2000 cycles to copy a string) -> use memcpy instead
 * - structs always cause problems: misalignments due to "compiler optimizations", use uintx_t types instead of enum and union instead of conversion to a pointer to a struct
